**Topic**:

Creating a web application that allows gamers to offer and receive mentorship for the popular online games League of Legends, Dota2, Starcraft2, and CS:GO.


**Description of web application**:

(InsertNameHere) is a web application that facilitates the interaction between those who wish to improve his or her skillset at a particular game (student/mentee) and those who are willing to offer his or her area of expertise in the same game (coach/mentor). A coach can choose to coach many different games and can decide to offer online mentoring (i.e. watching the user play and informing him/her of his/her mistakes over Skype or Teamviewer), or they can offer offline mentoring: meeting up with mentees face-to-face at an internet cafe to play together in real life. (InsertNameHere) also provides the added security of payments being dealt (for online for offline meet-ups), rather than players needing to pay at the physical location. 


**Why this web application is important**:

In current day, online gaming has evolved to something beyond a mere hobby. The introduction of competitive online gaming has not only paved the road for gamers to be able to earn a living by doing what they love: playing online games, but also bolstered motivation for casual players to improve their skills. On top of this, online gaming communities worldwide have increased in numbers, with many new players demanding coaching services. Mentors can meet this increasing demand through coaching via (InsertNameHere).


**How it works**:

After registering on (InsertNameHere), the user has the option of applying as coach. As a coach, his/her user profile will be displayed to all users on the website as someone who is proficient at a specificly listed game(s) and is offering his services at a price of his/her choosing (by dollars per hour), or at no cost if the coach decides to offer training out of the goodness of his/her heart. As a mentee/student, one can select the game he or she desires training for, select a suitable coach, pay (if there is a price that the coach wants), and send a message to the coach to decide on a time and date to hold the training. After the training, the mentee has the option of leaving a rating on the mentor's profile. Likewise, the mentor can leave a rating on the mentee's profile. 


**Features & Implementation Details (plan)**:
We plan to use (InsertDatabaseName) as our database. It will store user authorization details (username and password) as well as profile information of the user (Name, Games, coach or not, profile picture, ratings and reviews).


Sign up:

The user will register an account through form fields. The information will be entered into a database for authenticating the user (upon future attempts to sign in).

Login and User Authentication:

After the user signs up, his/her username and password are stored in a database. When he/she attempts to login, the inputted authentication details are checked with that in the database. 

User Profile: Coach/Mentor and Student/Mentee

When the profile is loaded, we retrieve the user data from the database. The data is dynamically added to the html page.
Coach and Student:
-Both have the ability to change their password, profile information, etc. These changes will be saved in the database.
Coach:
-Have the added feature of a badge that identifies them as a coach.
